### Notes from the binning workflow

I will be doing two separate binning workflows for two separate purposes.
First, I will manually bin hgcA+ genomes using anvi'o.
These bins will be used to investigate the metabolic potential of the methylating organisms.
Second, I will generate an uncurated set of bins made through automatic binning algorithms.
I won't look at the detailed metabolic pathways of these organisms, but will use them to look at the broad taxonomic composition of the community and observe general trends in metabolic pathways.
