## Readme for Hells Canyon Hg-methylator metagenome project

This directory contains the scripts used in the analysis of the HCC metagenomes to identify and characterize Hg methylating organisms.
This work is in prep for publication.
While all of the scripts used in the published work are contained here, this directory also includes many analyses that were not used in the manuscript.
Currently, the repository includes only the scripts, and none of the data.

Metagenomic sequencing data will be made available when the paper is sent in for review.

All of the geochemistry data has previously been published as a data release, here:
