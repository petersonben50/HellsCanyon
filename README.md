## Readme for Hells Canyon Hg-methylator metagenome project

This directory contains the scripts used in the analysis of the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC) metagenomes to identify and characterize Hg methylating organisms.
This work has been published in The ISME Journal as "Metabolically diverse microorganisms mediate methylmercury formation under nitrate-reducing conditions in a dynamic hydroelectric reservoir". Link here: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-023-01482-1.
While all of the scripts used in the published work are contained here, this directory also includes many analyses that were not used in the manuscript.

Currently, the repository includes only the scripts, and none of the data.
Raw metagenomic sequencing data are stored in the NCBI database under BioProject PRJNA878929 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA878929).
Processed sequencing data, including HgcA amino acid sequences, *hgcA* gene sequences, and genomic bins containing the hgcA gene are available online at FigShare under project #158018 (link: https://figshare.com/projects/Brown_Reservoir_sequence_data/158018).
All of the geochemistry data has previously been published as a data release, here: https://doi.org/10.5066/P9DT2B6J.
The geochemical data used in this study is included in Table S1 of the manuscript.
